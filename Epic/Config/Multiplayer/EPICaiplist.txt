// EpicAIPlist.txt - List for alternate AIP sets to be picked from before
// a MPI game. [IA also soon?]
//
// Translation: a way to pick a MOD before a game, and have it not
// cause bad assets, assuming the author wrote it well.
//
// Format of lines: AIP basename, space separator, description.  Lines
// starting with // are ignored.
//
// For each base name, there need to be at least 24 AIP files on disk:
// [basename][CPURace][HumanRace][PlanType].aip
//
// where CPURace & HumanRace are 'f' (Scion) or 'i' (ISDF). PlanType
// is one of the following:
// 0 - Startup
// 1 - Early game (1/4 chance of 1 or 3 being used)
// 2 - Early game (1/4 chance of 1 or 3 being used)
// 3 - Early game (1/4 chance of 1 or 3 being used)
// 4 - Early game (1/4 chance of 1 or 3 being used)
// A - Anti-Assault (when the humans have some heavy units)
// C - Coup de Grace - Human Recycler destroyed
// E - End-game - AI Recycler destroyed
// L - Late-game
// S - Anti-siege (humans near CPU recycler)
// X - Middle-game (50/50 chance of 1 or 3 being used)
// Y - Middle-game (50/50 chance of 1 or 3 being used)
//
// The first field on each line must be 5 characters or longer, or the
// line will be ignored.
